            <div id="blog">
                <p>
                    <strong>Savings and investments</strong> are key to financial prosperity. We have talked about
                    saving while investing or vice verser. In an effort to understand savings, so far, we have discussed
                    money market fund (MMF), and how it differs from banks savings account. Today, we are exploring
                    further and discuss government securities; treasurey bills and bonds. Specifically, treasurey bonds.

                <p>
                    <strong>Treasury bonds</strong> also known as T-bonds, are a secure, medium- to long-term investment
                    that typically offer you interest payments (coupon) every six months throughout the bond’s maturity.
                    The Central Bank Auctions Treasury bonds on a monthly basis, but offers a variety of bonds
                    throughout the year, so prospective investors should regularly check for upcoming auctions.
                    Alternatively, after primary issuance, treasury bonds are traded by authorized intermediaries at the
                    Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), giving investors an opportunity to invest in select bonds.

                <h3>Definition of terms</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong class="fun">Allow me to introduce you to the common terms in tresury bonds. They are not new
                        but
                        important for novice to understand and refer to as they familirize themselves with the
                        investment.</strong>
                </p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Face Value
                        </span> - The face value (also called as the par value) is the quantity of money a holder will
                        receive back once a bond matures. A newly issued bond generally sells at the par value.
                        <p>
                            What makes other people more confused is that the par value isn’t the price of the bond. A
                            bond's price wavers all through its life in reaction to a number of variables. When a bond
                            trades at a price higher the face value, it is thought to be selling at a premium. When a
                            bond sells lower than face value, it is thought to be selling at a discount.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Coupon rate
                        </span> - This is the interest rate that is used to calculate periodic interest, or coupon
                        payments, on the bond. It is important to note that coupon rates are always expressed in annual
                        terms, even if coupon payments are scheduled for different periods of time. The most common
                        periods for coupon payments other than annual are semiannual and quarterly. Coupon rates will
                        typically remain unchanged for the entire life of the bond. In our example, the coupon rate is
                        the 5% interest rate.
                        <p>
                            If a bond pays a coupon of 10% and its par value is Rs.10,000 its interest would be Rs.1000
                            annually. Rates that remain stay as a fixed percentage of the par value like these are
                            considered as Fixed-rate bond. Another possibility is flexible interest payment, referred to
                            as floating-rate bond where interest rate is tied up to market rates through an index, for
                            example the rate on Treasury bills.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One might presume investors will pay more for a high coupon than for a low coupon. All
                            things being equivalent, a lower coupon suggests that price of the bond will fluctuate more.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Coupon payment
                        </span> - This refers to the regular interest payment on the bond. The coupon or periodic
                        interest payment is determined by multiplying the par value of the bond by the coupon rate. It
                        is important to note that no adjustment needs to be made to the coupon rate if the bond pays
                        interest annually. However, if a bond pays interest on a semiannual or quarterly basis, the
                        coupon rate will have to be divided by 2 or 4, respectively, to convert the stated annual rate
                        to the correct periodic rate. In our example, coupons are paid annually, so the periodic or
                        annual interest that is paid is equal to $1,000×0.05=$50
                        . You may notice that because these payments are the same amount and made at regular intervals,
                        they constitute an annuity stream refer to Time Value of Money, Equal Multiple Payments.

                            Maturity date
                        </span> - The maturity date is the expiration date of the bond, or the point in time when the
                        term of a bond comes to an end. On the maturity date, the issuer will make the final interest or
                        coupon payment on the bond and will also pay off its principal, or face value. In our example,
                        the maturity date is at the end of the 20-year period.

                <h3>Types of treasury bonds issued by government of Kenya</h3>
                <p>
                    The types of Treasury bond may be defined by the purpose, interest rate
                    structure, maturity structure, and even by issuer. So far, the Government has
                    issued Fixed Coupon/Rate Bonds, Zero Coupon, Floating Rate, Infrastructure
                    (project specific), Restructuring/Special bonds, and Savings Development
                    bonds.
                    Most commonly issued bonds are fixed coupon bonds which have huge investor
                    demand. Treasury bonds are issued on monthly basis.

                            Fixed coupon treasury bonds
                        </span> - Bear predetermined or market determined fixed
                        coupon (interest) which is paid semiannually (every 6 months) on the face value held
                        during the life of the bond. When bought at a discount (required yield1 higher than
                        coupon), investor benefits from discount (capital gain) which is critical for secondary
                        market trading and regular interest payment.

                        in the prospectus. The coupon (interest) rate is fixed for the life of the bond.

                        average rate of 91-days or 182-days Treasury bill plus some margin. They are on high
                        demand in high inflationary environment. They are no longer issued by the

                        What are the disadvantages of investing in T-bonds?

                            Low returns
                        </span> - Because the government bonds are so safe, they typically offer lower returns than other types of investments such as stocks or corporate bonds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Interest rate risk
                        </span> - Government bonds are sensitive to changes in the interest rates. If the interest rate rise, the value of existing bonds may decrease resulting into lower returns for the investor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Inflation risk
                        </span> - If inflation rises, the purchasing power of the regular interest payment recieved from the government bond may decrease.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Market volatility
                        </span> - Although government bonds are generally considered to be safer investments, they are not immune to market volatility. Economic factors, political events and other factors can affect the value of government bond.
