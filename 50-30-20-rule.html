            <h2>
                The 50/30/20 rule explained
            </h2>
            <p>
                The 50/30/20 budget was reportedly conceived by Senator Elizabeth Warren and her daughter Amelia Warren Tyagi in their book, <strong>All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan üí∞ </strong>, which they co-wrote back when Warren was still teaching at Harvard Law.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 50/30/20 budget is based on <strong>after-tax income</strong> and stipulates that spend:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>50% of your income on needs</li>
                <li>30% of your income on wants</li>
                <li>20% of your income on savings</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The method gained popularity for its simplicity. There are no spreadsheets, pivot tables, or heuristics to memorize ‚Äî just three simple numbers. As long as you keep those three numbers in mind throughout the month, you‚Äôll budget pretty effectively.
            </p>
            <h2>
                50% for needs
            </h2>
            <p>
                Needs are mandatory expenditures that you simply can‚Äôt skip. Things like groceries, rent, childcare ‚Äî you know, ‚Äúadulting‚Äù stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here‚Äôs a general list of spending categories that fall into the needs bucket:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rent/mortgage</li>
                <li>Utilities</li>
                <li>Insurance premiums (auto, home, medical, etc.)</li>
                <li>Groceries</li>
                <li>Transportation (gas, bus fare, etc.)</li>
                <li>Wi-Fi and mobile data plans</li>
                <li>Therapy and mental health services</li>
                <li>Gym membership (debatable, since there are free ways to exercise)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>
                30% for wants
            </h2>
            <p>
                The middle spending category goes to ‚Äúwants‚Äù ‚Äî things that might make life better, but that you don‚Äôt necessarily need to pay for each month.
            </p>
            <p>
                Things that fall into the wants category include, but certainly aren‚Äôt limited to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Restaurants and takeout</li>
                <li>Entertainment and media subscriptions (Twitch, Netflix, etc.)</li>
                <li>Travel</li>
                <li>Concerts and movie tickets</li>
                <li>Online shopping</li>
                <li>Fashion</li>
                <li>Video games and consoles</li>
                <li>Alcohol</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Get the gist? And yeah, sometimes it can be hard to distinguish between a ‚Äúwant‚Äù and a ‚Äúneed.‚Äù We‚Äôll talk more about that in a bit.
            </p>
            <h2>
                20% for savings
            </h2>
            <p>
                Everybody always asks me what percentage of their income they should be saving each month. The answer is right here: At least 20 percent. Count any of the following as savings:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Money deposited into savings accounts</li>
                <li>Mutual funds like MMF</li>
                <li>Treasury bills and bonds</li>
                <li>Retirement savings</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>
                What if you can‚Äôt save 20%?
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you can‚Äôt save anywhere near 20% of your income, you‚Äôre not alone. Despite all of the advantages to living in the Kenya, our economy makes it harder and harder for most Kenyans to get ahead. Housing, food, education and healthcare cost WAY too much and jobs pay WAY too little. Add in a culture that worships consumerism and makes everyone feel like they need the newest iPhone and you‚Äôve got a recipe for financial disaster.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 50/30/20 budget may also be growing out of date. It was conceived in 2006 when the median rent in Kenya was around Kes 7000. Today, it‚Äôs Kes 15,000 and our cost of living continues to outpace wage growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can change the numbers! I heard someone propose that the rule should be updated to 60/30/10 as housing and other needs get more expensive. That makes sense to me. You can play with ratios to arrive at a budget that works for you as long as you‚Äôre making saving a priority. On the other extreme, if you‚Äôre very frugal you might live on a 50/20/30 budget.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Pros and cons of the 50/30/20 budget
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Pros
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It‚Äôs simple. Some budgeting methods call for complex spreadsheets, pivot tables, and more. But a 50/30/20 budget can be worked out quickly.</li>
                <li>It‚Äôs compatible with budgeting apps. Many modern budgeting apps have a 50/30/20 option already baked in, so you‚Äôre just taps away from holding yourself accountable with notifications, tracking, and more.</li>
                <li>Saving 20% is aggressive, but extremely effective. Just save 20% of your income for 30 years and you‚Äôre golden.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
                Cons
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>50% may not cover your needs.</li>
                <li>It can be hard to distinguish between wants and needs. Is hiring a personal trainer a ‚Äúwant‚Äù because it‚Äôs unnecessary? Or a ‚Äúneed‚Äù because it‚Äôs tied to your physical and mental health? 50/30/20 budgeters have to face these questions often.</li>
                <li>It‚Äôs not designed for debt structuring. As illustrated above, the 50/30/20 budget just wasn‚Äôt designed with debt repayment in mind, forcing folks to awkwardly shoehorn their debt into the 20% saving category.</li>
                <li>It‚Äôs not ideal for parents. As any parent knows, the costs associated with childcare are both high and unpredictable. You may find that raising children pushes your needs bucket to 60% or even 70%.</li>
            </ul>

                Conclusion
            </h2>
            <p>
                Everyday choice with every cent has a concequence. I am talking of the cent in your pocket and the cent in the economy. You should be striving to earn an extra cent. Then what comes after earning becomes the gap that we talked about above. Make sure you spend less than, in fact I say far more less than you earn.
