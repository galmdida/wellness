            <p class="quote">
                <span class="main-quote">“Planning is bringing the future into the present so that you can do something
                    about it.”</span>
                – Alan Lakein
            </p>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <div id="blog">
                <p>
                    I know something about you: you want to do something really significant with your life. Whether you
                    want to start a business, buy a house, marry, advance
                    your career, or transform the whole darn planet, you want to do something big and meaningful with
                    your life. You want to control your own destiny and know that your life has a deep purpose.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I know because it is human to dream and want the best for themselves. As much as my goals differ
                    from yours; who wants their things thrown out because they cannot pay the rent or have child at home
                    because they cannot pay school fees, or their parents struggling with sickness because they cannot
                    cover hospital bills? You see? Therefore, although the type of the car I want to drive, the size of
                    the family I want to build, or my career dream differs from yours, we all want to achieve great
                    things?
                </p>

                <p>
                    But the question is, why some people (in fact only very small percentage) are acheiving so much
                    while others left spinning their wheels? Well, we can
                    look to real achievers, in every walk of life, for the answer. Look at the great CEOs like like
                    Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos who blow our minds with their amazing and innovative products again and
                    again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Are these superachievers just more motivated? Or are they
                    more disciplined? The answer to both questions is yes, but not in the ways you might think. What these people have—what anyone who’s ever tasted greatness has — is SMART Goals. I will give more talk on this really soon. For today, allow me to talk about five steps to set your financial goals for the year 2025.
                </p>

                <h3>Consider working through these five steps to set your financial goals</h3>

                <ol type="i">
                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            List and prioritize your financial goals
                        </span>
                        <p>
                            Start by listing out your financial goals, both those you’re already working toward and those you haven’t started on yet. As you identify each goal, prioritize the list from most to least important. Write down specific details about each goal, such as the timeline, the amount of money you’ll need and how much you’ve already saved. This will help you understand what it will take to achieve each goal and build a plan. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Look at where your goals fall on your list of priorities and your timeline to determine which to address first. For example, you could have a short-term goal of taking a vacation or buying a new home. You may have longer-term goals, such as retirement, paying for a child’s college education, or giving to charitable causes. Priorities are personal and differ from person to person. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Keep in mind that it’s possible to save for more than one goal at a time, especially mixing short-term and long-term goals. For example, you could put money away for a vacation while continuing to contribute to retirement accounts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Knowing what’s most important to you will help you determine how to set money aside and how to adjust when setbacks happen. The financial priorities make it easier to make decisions in an optimal way.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Take care of the financial basics
                        </span>
                        <p>
                            Once you identify your goals, ensure your basics are covered. Depending on your stage of financial planning, these may either be on your list of goals or you may already have accomplished them. It’s a good idea to revisit them, though, to make sure you’re still on track. 
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span class="where-invest">
                                    Build an emergency fund
                                </span> - It’s important to have funds set aside for unexpected scenarios, such as medical expenses or a job loss. A good starting point is to have three to six months of your living expenses put into an easily accessible savings account. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="where-invest">
                                    Pay off debt
                                </span> -  If you have outstanding high-interest debt, such as credit cards, pay that off before saving for other goals. Freeing up money in your monthly cashflow by reducing expenses can help you get more traction on achieving your goals. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="where-invest">
                                    Save for retirement
                                </span> -  Put aside money for retirement on a consistent basis. The earlier you begin, the more you’ll benefit from the interest rate. Start by taking advantage of an employer-sponsored plan and employer match. If that’s not available to you, there are many other retirement accounts available to support your goal, such as annuities.  
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Having these financial basics in place gives you a strong foundation to build on when pursuing your other goals. 
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Connect each financial goal to a deeper motivation
                        </span>
                        <p>
                            Just as with fitness or career goals, tying your financial goals to specific motivations makes them more meaningful. As you review your goals, reflect on the purpose behind each one. What is the underlying motivation for it? Who is the goal going to benefit?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, a goal of setting up a trust might be tied to a larger desire to feel more secure about your family’s future. When documenting the detail behind the goal, get into the specifics. Understanding the ‘why’ helps you become more committed and understand how the goal is associated to other goals.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Make a financial plan to reach your financial goals
                        </span>
                        <p>
                            Now that you’re armed with your goals and motivations, the next step is to understand how they all work together in a financial plan. You can either do this work yourself or get help from a financial professional to understand how you’re positioned to achieve your goals.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One place to start is taking inventory of what you have and consider what you need. Document your income sources and expenses. Knowing how much money you can allocate to different goals each month gives you clear direction on how to move forward.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then, use your goals and their timelines as drivers for your financial plan. For example, if one of your goals is to buy a lake cabin, knowing when you want to buy that cabin and how much it will cost will inform decisions for your financial plan.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Revisit your financial goals regularly
                        </span>
                        <p>
                            Once you learn how to identify financial goals and have your plan in place, keep in mind that your framework will evolve over time. Life changes and other factors can affect your financial goals. It’s important to review your goals at least once a year to adjust expectations, chart your progress and review your priorities.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Any time something changes in your life or financial situation, it should be an indicator to review your goals. Your financial goals are an ongoing process that provide clarity and confidence for the future. You’re building a vision for the things you’re dreaming about and want to accomplish. Start the process and see the possibilities unfold.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When you take the time to reflect on the purpose behind your financial goals and put them in a realistic framework, you’re more likely to stay accountable to—and confident in—your financial plan. 
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    If you set a goal that is connected deeply to your feelings, you have a strong "why" behind it, clearly imagine yourself acheiving it, and work consistently towards it, then you can achieve it. Allow me to
                    conclude with the sayings from
                    <span class="fun-one">Pablo Picasso,
                        "Our goals can only be reached through a vehicle of a plan in which we must fervently believe, and upon which we must vigorously act"</span> Thank you for reading and happy 2025!
