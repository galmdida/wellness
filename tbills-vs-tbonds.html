            <h3>Treasury bills vs bonds</h3>
            <div id="blog">
                <p>
                    <strong>Savings and investments</strong> are key to financial prosperity. We have talked about
                    saving while investing or vice verser. In an effort to understand savings, so far, we have discussed
                    money market fund (MMF), and how it differs from banks savings account. We have explored
                    further and discuss government securities; treasurey bills and bonds. Today, we are discussing how
                    treasury bills differs from treasury bonds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Treasury bills and bonds</strong> are both government-backed debt securities. However, there
                    are some major differences between T-bills and T-bonds. Mainly, they vary in when the principal is
                    repaid, which is called the maturity of the security, how the interest is paid, pricing, liquidity,
                    and interest rate risk/ volatility.
                </p>

                <h3>The difference between t-bills and bonds</h3>
                <p>
                    Allow me to introduce you to the main difference of these major government securities. It is also
                    important to note that these securities vary from government to government and thus I will try to
                    disuss mainly for the government of the republic of Kenya and the federal government of United
                    States.
                </p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Maturity
                        </span> - Treasury bills offered by the government of Kenya has three main
                        maturities: 91 days, 182 days and 364 days. The t-bills offered by the federal
                        government of US are more flexible with six maturities: four weeks, eight weeks, 13
                        weeks, 17 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks. These flexibilities are key advantage for both offers as
                        they allows investors to better manage their short-term cash.
                        <p>
                            On the other hand, the t-bonds offered by the government of Kenya has long
                            term maturity from one year to 30 years. The t-bonds offered by the federal
                            government of US are more more fixed with only two maturities: 20 or 30 years.
                            However, in between, the US government offers Treasury notes with
                            maturities: Two, three, five, seven, or 10 years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To bypass the lengthy maturities, you can sell bonds before they mature (the same goes for
                            Treasury bills). In fact, this is a common practice, as each investor has unique goals and
                            requirements for their portfolio.

                            When you sell a Treasury bond, it results in a capital gain or loss, thanks to an inverse
                            relationship between the price of a bond and interest rate levels. When interest rates rise,
                            Treasury bond prices generally fall — and vice versa.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, suppose you bought a 20-year Treasury bond for $1,000 with a fixed interest
                            rate of 5%. After a year, the interest rate has risen to 7% but now you have a problem if
                            you want to sell. Your bond is less appealing to a buyer since the buyer can now purchase
                            the same type of security for $1,000 and get a higher rate. In order to sell your bond,
                            you'd have to try to offer a competitive yield, therefore you'd have to lower the price of
                            your security below $1,000 so as to push the yield to 7%. As a result, you'd lose out on
                            your principal investment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When rates are low, it's a great time to sell. Looking at the same 5% bond, if the interest
                            rate fell to 3%, the value of your bond will have increased. You'll have a capital gain if
                            you sell the bond in that instance.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Interest Payments/ Coupons
                        </span> - T-bills do not pay interest. Hence, they're called zero-coupon bonds. Instead,
                        Treasury bills are auctioned off to investors at a discount to their face value. Your return,
                        then, is the difference between the face value and the discounted price you initially paid.
                        <p>
                            Suppose you buy a Treasury bill with a Kes 100,000 face value for Kes 95,000. At maturity,
                            you will be paid Kes 100,000. The Kes 5,000 difference between the Kes 95,000 purchase price
                            and the Kes 100,000 face value is considered the interest.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once you buy T-bonds, you get a fixed-interest payment called the coupon every six months.
                            The coupon amount is given as a percentage of the bond's face value. For example, a bond
                            worth Kes 500,000 with a coupon rate of 10% would pay Kes 50,000 in interest each year.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At maturity, you're paid the bond's face value.
                            When you redeem bonds at maturity, the proceeds are deposited
                            automatically into the bank account. Compared with Treasury bills,
                            Treasury bonds usually pay the highest interest rates because investors want more money to
                            put aside for the longer term. For the same reason, their prices, when issued, go up and
                            down more than the others.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Pricing
                        </span> - T-bills are issued at a discount from the par value. A Kes 100,000 bill might cost the
                        investor Kes 95,000. When the bill matures, the investor is paid the face value — par value — of
                        the bill they bought. Since the face value exceeds the purchase price, the difference is the
                        interest earned for the investor.

                        <p>
                            If you buy a bond at issuance, the bond price is the face value of the bond, and the yield
                            will match the coupon rate of the bond. That is, if you buy a bond that pays 1% interest for
                            three years, that's exactly what you'll get. When the bond matures, its face value will be
                            returned to you. Its value at any time in between is of no interest to you unless you want
                            to sell it. The bond is priced either at discount, par, or premium. Let's look at each
                            briefly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A bond's shilling price represents a percentage of the bond's principal balance, otherwise
                            known as par value. A bond is simply a loan, after all, and the principal balance, or par
                            value, is the loan amount. So, if a bond is quoted at Kes 98.90 and you were to buy a Kes
                            10,000,000 twenty-year Treasury bond (Treasury note), you would pay Kes 9,800,900.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the example above, the two-year Treasury is trading at a discount. This means it is
                            trading at less than its par value. If it were "trading at par," its price would be 100. If
                            it were trading at a premium, its price would be greater than 100. Trading at a discount
                            means the price of the bond has declined since it was issued; it is now cheaper to buy the
                            bond than when it was issued.
                        </p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Liquidity
                        </span> - T-bills are more liquid compared to t-bond which is a long-term investment.
                        <p>
                            However, you can sell both t-bills or t-bonds in the secondary market. After a waiting
                            period of around 45 days, you can sell the bond to the bond to the secondary marker. The
                            sales can make profit or loss depending on the changes in the interest rates and inflation.
                            It is unlikely to get the face value if you sell it before maturity, so you could see a loss
                            between what you paid initially and what you get selling it.
                        </p>

                    <li>

                            Volatility
                        </span> - T-bills are not volatile. While treasury bills are very volitile. This is what we
                        mean.
                        <p>
                            Imagine you have purchased a bond at 1% for three years. Then, six months after your
                            purchase, the same bond issues another public offering. However, this bond is now offering
                            2% interest. You've already locked into your rate, but surely this change in interest rates
                            will impact the value of your bond?

                            In secondary markets, bonds may be sold for a premium or discount on their face value.
                            Therefore, although you might've paid Kes 100,000 for your bond when it was issued, the same
                            bond
                            may now be worth Kes 98,000 or Kes 102,000, depending on external factors like prevailing
                            interest
                            rates.

                    <strong>T-bills and bonds</strong> are great avenues for short term and long term investments. They are safe and convinient ways to stash away the money you do not
                    currently require to avoid the temptation of using it for an unintended purposes. Allow me to
