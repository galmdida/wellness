            <h2>
                Is investing in stocks worthwhile?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Whether or not investing in stocks is worthwhile depends on your aim and alternatives that are available
                to you. If you are willing to take on risk, then investing in shares is a way to profit from stock
                prices going up and dividend payments. However, remember that you could lose money and that past
                performance doesn't guarantee future returns.
            </p>
            <h3>
                There are two ways to earn a return on investment from the company shares you own:
            </h3>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>
                    Share price appreciation
                </li>
                <li>
                    Income from dividends
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>
                i. Share price appreciation
            </h3>
            <p>
                Share price appreciation occurs when you buy stocks and sell them at a higher price. The greater the
                difference between the buy and sell price of your stock, the higher your return on investment.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, investing in an index like the S&P 500, which contains 500 large US companies and
                aggregates their individual performances into a single index. Historical financial market data shows
                that the S&P 500 appreciated over a 25-year period and peaked at 370% return.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that buying shares in an index like the S&P 500 often yields better returns over time compared to
                individual company stocks since each carries its own risk.
            </p>
            <h3>
                ii. Income from dividends
            </h3>
            <p>
                Dividends are periodic payments a company makes to shareholders from its revenue. Not all companies make
                dividend payments, meaning you’ll only earn these if the company you’ve invested in pays them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stocks that are known to pay regular and stable dividends are known as ‘dividend stocks’ or ‘income
                stocks’. Dividends can be paid into your account for withdrawal or used to buy more shares. Note that
                dividends from common stock and preferred stock are treated differently.
            </p>
            <p>
                Earning a dividend income can make a huge difference to your returns over time. You can build long term
                wealth by reinvesting your cash divided using the compounding effect, yielding more returns from that
                lump sum. Compounding is exponential, meaning even though the initial amount might be small in the short
                term, the value of your investment portfolio will grow significantly in the long term.
            </p>

                Potential advantages to buying stock
            </h2>
            <p>
                The potential advantages of buying stock is earning an income, mostly through passive investing. The
                returns form the stock market also tend to occur at a faster pace than the inflation rate.
            </p>
            <p>
                The large number of buyers and sellers available on the stock exchange make stocks more liquid, making
                them faster to sell compared to real estate which are non-liquid assets that take longer to convert into
                cash. That being said, buying stock does carry risk too, which we explore later.
            </p>
            <h3>

                        Higher returns than cash investment
                    </span> - Cash investments are low risk, but returns are low, too. Shares are riskier, but the
                    potential rewards can far exceed interest earned on savings.

                        Share price appreciation
                    </span> - Companies are productive assets in the business of earning revenue. If revenue (current or
                    projected future earnings) increases, a share of ownership in the company becomes more valuable,

                    a while, thereby protecting wealth against the corrosive effects of a rise in prices.

                    invest small amounts at your discretion. With property and mortgages, you’re expected to pay the

                    yourself the following fundamental questions that’ll help you to establish the investment approach
                    that’s most suitable to you: why am I investing? Am I looking to gradually grow a capital amount? Or

                    assume more risk as you’re less exposed to the day-to-day share price volatility. If your investment
                    horizon is shorter, you’d probably want lower risk stock since you’d be more exposed to price
                    fluctuations.

                    you’re risk neutral. However, if you have a risk-seeking profile, it would mean you’re actively

                As a preferred stockholder, your expected revenue stream tends to be more dependable since your dividend
                payout is a fixed amount and it’s prioritised above that of common shareholders. The income you earn
                from your shares is likely to be relatively higher compared to common stockholders.

                Being a preferred shareholder, you’re privy to a variety of this type of shares such as cumulative and
                participatory preferred shares, to name a few.

                        Cumulative preferred shares
                    </span> - have a clause that protects you when company profits take a hit. These enable unpaid
                    dividends to first be paid out to you as a preferred shareholder before common stockholders.
                </li>

                    <span class="list-title">
                        Participatory preferred shares
                    </span> - refer to when you’re guaranteed additional dividend payouts above the normal fixed
                    dividend rate, provided the company you’ve invested in meets specific financial objectives.

                Investing in ETFs vs stocks
            </h3>
            <p>
                Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are instruments that track the performance of a group of underlying assets.
                These can range from stock index ETFs, which track indices like the FTSE 100, to currency or sector ETFs
                that trail multiple currencies and companies in the same industry, respectively. ETF shares offer a single-entry point for increased access to a wide variety of markets and assets, which helps to diversify your risk.

            <p>
                In conclusion, shares are a unit of ownership of a company. They are traded on stock exchanges and can,
                in some cases, grant shareholder privileges such as voting rights and the issuing of dividends. However,
                shares can be volatile and investors can stand to lose their money. This is why they need to do their
                own research, remember that prices can go down as well as up and never invest more money than they can
                afford to lose.
