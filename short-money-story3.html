            <h3>ALI AND HALIMA</h3>
            <div id="blog">
                <p>
                    Ali and Halima are in their late twenties. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ali has a budding career in finance, while Halima is still finishing up graduate school in health care. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ali told me that “mom is my lifeline, and still works as a nurse. My father had a successful business but was always stressed about money. Then in 2017, his business failed and he has never been the same”. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ali and I talk a bit further and it is clear to me he is both excited about his future life together with his wife to be and very anxious. He can’t say that he is anxious, but I can tell by the pace of his story which reveals his anxiety. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ali tells me Halima likes to spend without thinking about the cost of anything. As a finance guy, he knows this is problematic, but he is feeling uncertain about what to do. Ali expresses that he would like Halima to set up an emergency fund but she won't talk about it. It leaves me curious about Halima's experiences with life and money that causes her to avoid talking about money with Ali.
