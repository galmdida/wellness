            <div id="blog">
                <p>
                    <strong>Money Market Fund (MMF)</strong> has gained momentum among the Kenyan investors. This popularity is due to affordable initial deposit, security, liquidity and returns on the fund. It is a Unit Trust Fund (UTF) managed by professional fund manager. I am sure by now you are asking "What the heck is UTF?" As I define UTF, I will be describing the operations of MMF in layman's.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>A unit trust</strong> pools contributions of many investors into one large fund (pooled fund), which can then be invested in a variety of financial products including treasury and corporate bonds, and shares and properties. These funds provide a good investment option due to the nature of “collective investments”, which benefits from the expertise of fund management that diversifies your money and lowers the risk of losing your money. Unit trusts are regulated by the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) and an independent trustee who is the registered holder of the scheme’s underlying assets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, we can say MMF is a type of mutual fund. <strong>Mutual fund</strong> is a company that pools money from many investors and invests the money in securities such as stocks, bonds, and short-term debts. While investing in MMF, you are indirectly investing in shares, bonds and other securities. In Kenya, the fund is mainly invested in quality short-term securities – Treasury Bills, fixed deposit instruments, negotiated commercial banks fixed deposit, high-quality corporate commercial and near cash holdings.The pooled fund is important as your small contribution will get a better negotiation and managed by a professional fund manager who understands returns and portfolio diversification. Really? you want me to define portfolio, no!

                    <li><span class="where-invest">Investor</span> - The person who has contributed to the fund.</li>
                    <li><span class="where-invest">A Professional Fund Manager</span> - which is a company registered and regulated by the Capital Markets Authority (CMA).

                    <strong class="question">How is MMF performing in Kenyan market?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Money Market Funds</strong> are the greatest avenues to invest in because of the safety they provide to your investments besides providing the higher returns than the normal banks fixed accounts. They also provide liquidity to investors since the funds are invested in short term securities that can be easily liquidated for cash.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most MMFs offer returns on investments ranging from <strong>12.0% to 15.9%</strong>. The current inflation rate is at <strong>6.9%</strong>, meaning that the returns from the MMFs are <span class="yes">inflation beating</span>. They also provide higher returns than bank deposits. For example, the average returns for MMFs is 12.9% while average returns on bank deposits is 6.4%.
                </p>

                <ol type="i">
                    <p>
                        <strong class="question">Why invest in Money Market Funds?</strong>
                    </p>
                    <li><span class="where-invest">Scope for good return</span> - Fund managers have various options to invest in; therefore, the portfolio gets diversified, resulting in MMFs generating equitable returns. MMFs also offer average returns of 12.9% that are higher than inflation rates of 6.4% and the rates offered by current accounts.</li>
                    <li><span class="where-invest">Liquidity</span> - Money Market Funds provide investors with liquidity because they invest in securities that mature in short periods of time and can be easily liquidated for cash. This allows investors to come in and out of the funds at will.</li>
                    <li><span class="where-invest">Regulatory oversight</span> - MMFs are licensed and regulated by the CMA, which ensures the investments are made under the scope of the law. The functions of the Fund Manager, Custodian, Trustee and Auditor are separated, which contributes to the security of your investments, besides making MMFs low risk investments. CMA ensures all the operations of the MMFs are compliant with the guidelines laid out.</li>
                    <li><span class="where-invest">Continuous professional management of the investments</span> - MMFs are managed by a team of experienced professionals who manage the fund in a structured and organized manner as opposed to the individual investor who may invest in random fashion. Investment decisions made by the fund managers are based on extensive research, and continuous monitoring of the portfolio based on researched information. These professionals constantly keep track of the market changes and news, predict the impact they will have on the investments and take quick decisions regarding the adjustments to be made in the portfolio.</li>
                    <li><span class="where-invest">Low Minimum Investment amounts</span> - Most MMFs have low minimum investment amount (as low as Kshs 1,000, others as low as Kshs 500), which is affordable by people in most facets of the economy. This provides the opportunity to invest and grow your income.</li>
                    <li><span class="where-invest">Low costs of Investment</span> - Due to the large amount of funds that the Fund Manager manages, very low costs accrue per investor. The Fund achieves economies of scale in research, transactions and investments.</li>
                    <li><span class="where-invest">Diversification</span> - Investors in MMFs can access a broader range of securities than they would when investing on their own. A common investor has limited money, which he can invest only in a few securities, and faces a great risk, but when pooled with other investors’ funds, it could be spread out over other companies.</li>
                    <li><span class="where-invest">MMFs help in cultivating a savings culture</span> - For people who lack savings culture, making constant top ups on your MMF investment will improve your saving habit, which will turn into a productive saving culture. The constant effort will reap off when you are in need of cash.</li>
                    <li><span class="where-invest">Avoid bad debt</span> - The investment acts as sinking fund to save for emergency, school fees, and business. This help the investor to insure against life uncertanities.</li>
                </ol>

                <ol type="i">

                        <strong class="question">What you should look for when choosing a Money Market Fund in Kenya?</strong>
                    </p>
                    <li><span class="where-invest">Past performance of the fund</span> - You should focus on the average returns of the MMF. CMA requires the MMFs to post their daily returns on the local newspapers, which can be a great source to track the daily returns of the Fund Managers to help you make proper investments decisions. It is important to also assess the diversification of a Fund’s investments to better understand the portfolio.</li>
                    <li><span class="where-invest">Minimum Investment</span> - You should know the minimum amount you require to open an account with the company for you to begin investing. Most MMFs have low minimum investment amount (as low as Kshs 500), which is affordable by many people in the country.</li>
                    <li><span class="where-invest">Consistency</span> - Try to look for consistency in the returns of general market funds as this will help identify a stable source of income.</li>
                    <li><span class="where-invest">Compounding frequency</span> - Your returns should grow with time as not only your initial investment but also the interest itself earns interest. How frequent is compounding? daily, monthly and so on. Choose the most frequent fund.</li>
                    <li><span class="where-invest">Flexibility</span> - Life is full of surprises, the fund is designed to accommodate them. You can access your funds when you need them, ensuring you're always prepared for unexpected expenses or opportunities. The flexibility covers also the chances for top ups. most frequent with least top up might favor your investment.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    <strong class="question">Conclusion</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Money Market Funds</strong> MMF is a good investment plan for indiduals and group of persons with the same financial goals. However, I am not ruling out the advantages of bank saving accounts over the MMF. In my next "Finance Wednesday" I will cover the differences between bank saving accounts and MMF.
