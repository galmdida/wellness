            <h3>What is a credit card?</h3>
            <div id="blog">
                <p>
                    <strong>A credit card</strong> is a payment card, usually issued by a bank or financial services
                    company or specific stores, allowing the cardholders to purchase goods or services or withdraw cash
                    on credit. Using the card thus accrues debt that has to be repaid later. They impose the condition
                    that cardholders pay back the borrowed money, plus any applicable interest, as well as any
                    additional agreed-upon charges, either in full by the billing date or over time. Credit cards are
                    one of the most widely used forms of payment across the world.
                </p>

                <ol type="i">
                    <li>
                        Pay for good and services on credit.

                <h3>What to consider before getting the credit card?</h3>
                <p>
                    When you’re thinking about getting a new credit card, it’s important to think about what you’d like
                    to do with it. When you’re ready to start your search, here are a few things to look out for:
                </p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Card type
                        </span> - There are different types of cards to consider. Do I want a <span
                            class="credit">credit builder card</span> to improve my credit rating, <span
                            class="credit">a purchase card</span> to help budget for a big expense, <span
                            class="credit">a balance transfer card</span> to consolidate all my debts, or <span
                            class="credit">a rewards card</span> to take advantage of great offers?
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            0% period
                        </span> - There are many cards offering 0% interest for different periods – sometimes up to 45
                        days or longer. If this is important to you, remember to compare different deals and consider
                        any add-on fees
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Card limit
                        </span> - Consider what is a sensible credit limit for you. A high credit limit can
                        provide added flexibility, but a lower limit could reduce the risk of getting into debt.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Extra charges
                        </span> - There could be added fees on certain cards, particularly those offering perks and
                        cashback. Weigh up if the fee is worth paying for the benefit.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Fee-free overseas
                        </span> - Think about whether you’re likely to need to use the card abroad. There are some cards
                        that allow you to spend money abroad without extra charges.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>What are the advantages of the credit card?</h3>
                <p>
                    There are many advantages to using a credit card. Some of the benefits include:
                </p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Go interest-free
                        </span> - Plenty of credit cards offer a 0% interest period. So you can borrow for free - with
                        no interest charged, so long as you make your minimum monthly repayments.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Convinience
                        </span> - Using a credit card lets you buy something today but put off the real cost until
                        payday rolls around – so you don’t have to wait.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Spread out the cost
                        </span> - If you need to make a big purchase, a credit card lets you pay over several monthly
                        instalments. This can help with budgeting and, as long as you ensure you make your
                        repayments, it won’t leave a huge hole in your finances.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Cashbacks and rewards
                        </span> - Many credit card providers offer a range of rewards to customers. You could be getting
                        air miles or shopper loyalty points each time you use your card, or even cashback on purchases.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Boost your credit score
                        </span> - If you use a credit card responsibly, lenders will notice – and it can help to improve
                        your credit score. If you have a low credit rating, you can get a credit builder credit card
                        designed to help you build up your score.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Record expenses
                        </span> - A credit card records each purchase made through the card, with a detailed list sent
                        with your monthly credit card statement. This can be used to determine and track your spending
                        and purchases, which could be useful when chalking out a budget or for tax purposes. Lenders
                        also provide instant alerts each time you swipe your card, detailing the amount of credit still
                        available as well as the current outstanding on your card.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Purchase protection
                        </span> - Credit cards offer additional protection in the form of insurance for card purchases
                        that might be lost, damaged or stolen. The credit card statement can be used to vouch for the
                        veracity of a claim, if you wish to file one.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>What are the disadvantages of the credit card?</h3>
                <p>
                    Getting a credit card can come with pitfalls and drawbacks. Some of the risks you should be aware of
                    include:
                </p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Minimum due trap
                        </span> - The biggest con of a credit card is the minimum due amount that is displayed at the
                        top of a bill statement. A number of credit card holders are deceived into thinking the minimum
                        amount is the total due they are obliged to pay, when in fact it is the least amount that the
                        company expects you to pay to continue receiving credit facilities.

                        This results in customers assuming their bill is low and spending even more, accruing interest
                        on their outstanding, which could build up to a large and unmanageable sum over time.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Easy to overuse
                        </span> - With revolving credit, since your bank balance stays the same, it might be tempting to
                        put all your purchases on your card, making you unaware of how much you owe. This could lead to
                        you overspending and owing more than you can pay back, beginning the cycle of debt and high
                        interest rates on your future payments.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Getting trapped in the debt
                        </span> - If you can’t pay back what you borrow, your debts can pile up quickly. If you have bad
                        credit, you could get hit with high interest rates – and once you’re in spiralling debt, it can
                        be difficult to pay it all off.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Damage your credit score
                        </span> - Your credit score can go down as well as up. Miss a payment on your
                        card or allow debt to stack up and this can damage your credit rating. This can make it harder
                        to get credit in the future.
                    </li>

                            Extra fees
                        </span> - The interest rate isn’t the only number you need to look out for when choosing a
                        credit card – there may be extra charges too. Your provider could impose fees if you miss a
                        payment, go over your credit limit or withdraw cash, which is bad news if you’re already in the
                        red. Some credit cards might also have a monthly or annual fees.

                            Limited use
                        </span> - Credit card providers might charge you extra for things that are free with a debit
                        card, such as withdrawing cash from an ATM or buying things overseas.
                    </li>

                            Credit card fraud
                        </span> - Though not very common, there are chances you might be victim of credit card fraud.
                        With advances in technology, it is possible to clone a card and gain access to confidential
                        information through which another individual or entity can make purchases on your card. Check
                        your statements carefully for purchases that look suspicious and inform the bank immediately if
                        you suspect card fraud. Banks usually waive off charges if the fraud is proven, so you will not
                        have to pay for purchases charged by the thief.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Avoid putting daily purchases on your card so that you're aware of how much you're spending.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Periodically check your credit limit and rein in spending when you've crossed 40% of your
                        available credit limit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Always keep at least 40% of your credit limit for emergencies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Plan your purchases and use your card only for planned purchases. Avoid impulse buys on your
                        credit card.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Always try to pay your credit card bills in full each month to avoid the interest charges.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Never miss a card payment, as this will result in higher charges and a hefty penalty.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Approach the bank if you've overspent on your card. They could help you devise a pay-back plan
                        with a fixed rate of interest to avoid you falling deeper into debt.
                    </li>

                <p>
                    <strong>Credit card</strong> gives you convinient and cheap credit when you understand it well and
                    apply financial discipline. It can however be a pitfall if used without care. Therefore, at the time
                    you are getting the card, get the details, read terms and conditions and as I advise for every
                    single purchase whether cash or through loan, delay and think about it. Allow me to
                    conclude with the sayings from
                    <span class="fun-one">Suze Orman,
                        "Your goal should be to pay off your credit card bills in full at the end of each month and set
                        aside money toward your emergency savings!"</span> Thank you for reading!
