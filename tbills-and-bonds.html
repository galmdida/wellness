            <h3>Treasury Bills</h3>
            <div id="blog">
                <p>
                    <strong>Savings and investments</strong> are key to financial prosperity. We have talked about
                    saving while investing or vice verser. In an effort to understand savings, so far, we have discussed
                    money market fund (MMF), and how it differs from banks savings account. Today, we are exploring
                    further and discuss government securities; treasurey bills and bonds. Specifically, treasurey bills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Treasury bills</strong> also known as T-bills, are a secure, short-term investment, offering
                    you returns after a relatively short commitment of funds (usually less than 1-year; 91-days,
                    182-days or 364-days). Treasury bill rates in Kenya are attractive, providing an excellent
                    investment opportunity that is readily available, as they are auctioned each week.

                    They are sold at a discount. This means that investors choose the amount that they will receive when
                    the bill matures, or the face value of the bill, and pay less than that amount when purchasing it.
                </p>

                <h3>Definition of terms</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong class="fun">Allow me to introduce you to the common terms in tresury bills. They not new but
                        important for novice to understand and refer to as they familirize themselves with the
                        investment.</strong>
                </p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Par value
                        </span> - With t-bills, you agree with the issuer, mostly the government through the central
                        bank, that you will be paid some specific amont in the future for your current investment. This
                        amount you are promised to be paid on maturity is what we call par value. Also known as <strong>face value.</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Purchase value
                        </span> - This is the amount paid by the investor at the beginning of the investment period for them to get the par value. This amount is the principal investment plus returns on investment/ yeild.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Discount rate
                        </span> - When the interest is paid at the start of the period, it is known as discount rate. This is the case with t-bills as you work with the maturity amount.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>The Features of treasury bills</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong class="fun">In order to understand the concept clearly, let's look at the characteristics of
                        treasury bills.</strong>
                </p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Minimum initial deposit
                        </span> - The minimum initial deposit for treasury bill is Kes. 100,000.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Minimum and frequency of top up
                        </span> - They are offered on weekly basis, thus you can top up weekly with a minimum top up of
                        Kes. 100,000.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Interest paid upfront
                        </span> - Treasury bills earn returns in form of a discount due to their short tenure. The
                        discount/interest is enjoyed upfront at the point of purchase. For instance, if you purchase
                        T-bills worth 1 million shillings, you will pay Kshs. 900,000 and the Kshs. 100,000 becomes your
                        return/interest.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Annualized rate
                        </span> - The interest paid out is annualized, that is, it is calculated over 12 months and
                        multiplied by the number of days of the T-bill.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Taxation
                        </span> - Treasury bills attract a 15% witholding tax which is imposed on the return, which we
                        call discount.
                    </li>

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>T-Bills</strong> are short term securities; hence they are more suited as a tool to
                    accumulate capital
                    for projects/longer-term investments. They are a way to stash away the money you do not
                    currently require to avoid the temptation of using it for an unintended purposes. Allow me to
                    conclude with the sayings from
                    <span class="fun-one">Bill Gross,
                        "Finding the best person or the best organization to invest your money is one of the most important financial decisions you'll ever make!"</span> Thank you for reading!
