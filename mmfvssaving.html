                    <span class="my_name">Welcome to our Wellness Wednesday column</span>. As promised in our previous session, today we are going to learn the difference between MMF and bank saving accounts. <span class="disclaimer">Disclaimer:</span> The content of this articles consists of market research, contributions from colleagues and personal opinions. Therefore, take this engagement as bear minimum in learning and do further research for making financial decisions.

                <p>
                    <strong>Life is full of uncertanities</strong>. You can barely predict your job security, your health, your home, and natural calamities such as severe drought, flood, and earthquake. All of which would have major effects on your financial wellbeing. If you lose your job today, for how long would you keep your current living standard? or your room will be locked by the end of the month? How about health? Well, you may think of insurance. Good idea. But it cannot cover everthing for you, or how about the source of your insurance premium. On the other side of the coin, what about achieving your personal goals; that house you wanna build, that vacation you wanna take, that car you wanna purchase, the list is long. For you to achieve this, without running into bad debt, you need to put something a side regularly and consistently for specific purposes. We can call this savings.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Saving</strong> is the act of keeping the portion of income not spent on the current expenditure safely for it to be available when the need arise. This is an important culture that help individuals in acheiving short term and long term financial goals and avoid bad debts. The question we want to answer is where to keep this money. The aim of this article is to cover two common saving vehicles; saving accounts and money market funds. Allow me to compare them on seven grounds.
                </p>
                
                <ol type="i">
                    <li><strong class="question">Where is the fund in invested?</strong>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Saving accounts</strong> - the bank use the funds from saving accounts for personal loan, car loan, mortgages and other retail financing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Money market fund</strong> - the bank/ investment institution use the funds to invest in short-term, highly liquid and low risk assets.
                    </p>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong class="question">Liquidity and security</strong>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Saving accounts</strong> - the fund in the saving accounts are highly liquid (2-3hrs) and can be withdrawn on the savers request. Besides, the fund is insured against loss regardless of bank situation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Money market fund</strong> - the fund in MMF is liquid (48hrs). Although the fund is invested in the low risk assets and regulated by CMA, there is no insurance against the loss of principal.
                        </p>
                        </li>

                    <li><strong class="question">Minimum initial deposit and minimum balance</strong>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Saving accounts</strong> - Do not require minimum initial deposit nor minimum balances to be operated. However, in high interest earning cases, there might be initial deposit or minimum account balance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Money market fund</strong> - There is always minimum initial deposit and minimum balances to be operated.
                        </p>
                        </li>

                        <li><strong class="question">Minimum and frequency of top up</strong>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Saving accounts</strong> - There is no minimum top up nor a strict frequency of top-up. The invistor can add any amount at any given time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Money market fund</strong> - There is always minimum top up amount and sometimes frequency of top up. Depending on the providers, there is minimum to be added by the investor and the specific time to add to the fund.
                            </p>
                            </li>

                            <li><strong class="question">Return on the investment and compounding effect</strong>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Saving accounts</strong> - Traditionally, the interest rate offered are low and nominal. By nominal we mean only the principal investment earns interest over the period. However, there are some banks that offer high interest rates and also compounding, where the interest itself earn interest. You have to be aware of compounding period.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Money market fund</strong> - The interest rate is higher than that of traditional savings account and the interest earned is compounding, meaning, the interest itself earns interest. Sounds sexy right, how frequent is the compounding is what you should be asking the provider.
                                </p>
                                </li>

                                <li><strong class="question">Maintenance fees, transactional charges, and government tax</strong>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Saving accounts</strong> - There is no maintenance fees for most of the banks, the transaction is free over the counter and there is 15% government tax not on the principal but on the interest earned. This is specifically in Kenya.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Money market fund</strong> - There is maintenance fees by the brokers. This can go upto 5% depending on where you have made the investment. There is transaction cost and government tax as in the saving account.
                                    </p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li><strong class="question">Fluctuation of the interest rate</strong>
                                        <p>
                                            <strong>Saving accounts</strong> - The interest rates on the saving accounts are changing over time. But no as frequent as the one for money market fund.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <strong>Money market fund</strong> - The interest rate change on daily basis adding some level of uncertaininty.
                                        </p>
                                        </li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>
                    <strong class="question">Conclusion</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Money Market Funds and Savings Account</strong> are good avenues for saving over short term while earning interest. However, they are not quick way to cash as the risk involved are low  and as the most of the us think. The infation beating savings account can be considered by the savers with small amount of money who want to create a culture of frequent savings. This is advisable as the savings account do not have minimum initial deposit nor minimum top up. Another advantage of saving accounts over MMF is the lack of maintenance fees and transaction costs. On the other side, If you have large amount of money which you want to keep over a little longer period, you may consider MMF as it earns higher interest rates and the transaction cost and maintenance fees are reduced on the economies of scale. In our next Wednesday column, we will learn how to build a saving culture. Enjoy your week, keep saving.
